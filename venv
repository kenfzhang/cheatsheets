Setting up Python environments with venv and requirements.txt
In requirements.txt, you can list packages you need:
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
```

For each entry, you can specify the specific version:
```
numpy==1.25.2
```

To create a virtual environment, go to the root of a project and run:
$ python -m venv <name>
Where <name> is the name of the directory to store your environment
Usually, it's named something like "venv"

Once the virtual env is created, you can activate it with:
$ source venv/bin/activate

To deactivate the environment:
$ deactivate
