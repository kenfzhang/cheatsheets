To write tests in Go, use the `testing` package. 
To run the tests, use the `go test` command.
Tests are written in go files ending in "_test.go"
If you have a .go file called "hello.go", you can write tests for it in
a file named "hello_test.go".

A basic unit test might look like the following:
Suppose we want to test the following function in `main.go`:
```
package main

func AddOne(n int) int {
	return n + 1
}
```

We can write tests for that function in `main_test.go` as follows:
```
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func Test(t *testing.T) {
	type testCase struct {
		n int
		expected int
	}
	tests := []testCase{
		{1,2},
		{4,5},
		{8,9},
	}
	for _, test := range tests {
		output := AddOne(test.n)
		if output != test.expected {
			// code that executes during failure
		}
	}
}
```

Then, call `$ go test` to run the tests in `main_test.go`.
