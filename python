String formatting with f-strings
```
location = "San Diego"
temp = "72"
print(f"It is currently {temp} degrees F in {location}.")
# It is currently 72 degrees F in San Diego.
```

Unit testing
You can create a .sh script containing the line:
```
python3 -m unittest discover -s <location of test files>
```
Then, in <location of test files>, add .py files with the format:
```
import unittest

class TestFeature(unittest.TestCase):
	def test_eq(self):
		<...>
		self.assertEqual(value1, value2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	unittest.main()
```
